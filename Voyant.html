      <a href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/hemans/records/rossi.html">“Properzia Rossi”</a> is a poem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Hemans">Felicia Hemans.</a> It is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properzia_de%27_Rossi">Properzia Rossi,</a> a woman who falls in love with a Roman knight, tries but fails to make him love her, and dies of a broken heart.In addition, the poem consists of an introduction and four stanzas. My intent is to compare and contrast how Hemans presents this love story in her stanzas. From the beginning, I noticed from the word cloud that heart (9); oh (7); song (6); deep (5); and fame (5) are the most frequently used words in all of the stanzas, as shown here  </p>

<p> As the diagram shows, there is kind of harmony between “heart” “sad” and “song” in the way the sections in which they appear begin; however, they change their track in file 3 (stanza 2). This change indicates that the second stanza explains Properzia Rossi’s suffering and reflects Hemans’s reaction to the story. These findings encouraged me to narrow my focus to the interaction between “soul” and “sad.”  </p>

<p>In file 3, you can see how the instances in which these words are used have similar beginnings and start to change. These similarities reflect sadness about the event and the emotion between the author and the text. As a result, I examined a final trend to see the correlation between “sad,” “song,” and “soul.”  </p>

<p>Here, the finding shows great harmony in the uses of these three words and establishes that the emotion here is really negative (sadness). Additionally, to some extent, I can confirm that files 2 and 4, which consist of stanzas 1 and 3, underscore much the same sadness. 
All in all, this was an attempt to examine the significance of the most frequently used words in the poem by using a wonderful tool. It helped me to confirm that this is a sad love poem.

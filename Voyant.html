      <a href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/hemans/records/rossi.html">“Properzia Rossi”</a> is a poem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Hemans">Felicia Hemans.</a> It is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properzia_de%27_Rossi">Properzia Rossi,</a> a woman who falls in love with a Roman knight, tries but fails to make him love her, and dies of a broken heart. My purpose is to examine how Hemans embodies this great love story in her poem. After I posted the lines by Hemans, I looked at Cirrus and the results did not surprise me. Words such as “heart,” “oh,” “song,” “deep,” and “fame” appeared, as shown: </p>

<p> 
Encouraged, I decided to see how the word “heart” is collocated in the content. I found that it is followed by “soul,” “song,” and “thoughts.” I noticed that “heart song” appeared two times. This is shown here: </p>

<p>
Finally, I used links instead of trends to help me to see the frequency of the words and choose the connections between them. I found that “heart,” “song,” and “oh” are the most frequently used words in this poem. More specifically, this helped me to see that “heart” appears nine times, and two of them are collocated with “whereon.” “Song” appears six times and is followed by “came,” “burn,” and “art,” and “oh” appears seven times and is followed by words such as “dreams,” “birth,” and “form,” as shown: </p>

This net has helped me to discover Hemans’ poem and has provided worthy ideas to consider. For instance, if I write a paper in the future, I could analyze “song” and “art” in “Properzia Rossi.” To conclude, I would like to say that this was just a trial run; however, it helped me to discover this poem, and I am sure that there are more ideas worthy to discover by using the tools that the Voyant program provides to us as researchers in Literature. </p>

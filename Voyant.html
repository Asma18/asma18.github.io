      <a href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/hemans/records/rossi.html">“Properzia Rossi”</a> is a poem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Hemans">Felicia Hemans.</a> It is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properzia_de%27_Rossi">Properzia Rossi,</a> a woman who falls in love with a Roman knight, tries but fails to make him love her too, and dies of a broken heart.In addition, the poem consists of an introduction and four stanzas. My intent is to compare and contrast how Hemans presents this love story in her stanzas. From the beginning, I noticed from the word cloud that heart (9); oh (7); song (6); deep (5); and fame (5) are the most frequently used words in all of the stanzas, as shown here:  </p>

      <p> This data encouraged me to adopt a psychological approach by tracing the speaker’s emotional progress and expression to study the interaction between the text and the author. Hence, I started to trace “heart,” “song,” sad”: </p>

      <iframe style='width: 40%; height: 390px' src='//voyant-tools.org/?query=heart&query=song&query=sad&withDistributions=raw&bins=3&docIndex=0&view=Trends&corpus=305ddd6e69bfce57c7e4f0035036c21d'></iframe>
      
<p> As the diagram shows,the trend of the word “heart” is at the top of the raw frequencies words. Whereas, the trend of “song” comes in the second, but it is worthy to notice that these two words are used parallelly with the “heart” in the upper. Moreover, the trend of “sad” starts at the same level that “song” had, and it goes down in file two (stanza 1), and it stops near the word “song”. Ultimately, the best interpretation that these findings suggest about the speaker’s psychology is singing a sad song because of sadness love that affects the speaker’s heart. As a result, these findings promote me to narrow my focus more deeply to the interaction between “soul” and “sad.”  </p>

<p>In file 3, you can see how the instances in which these words are used have similar beginnings and start to change. These similarities reflect sadness about the event and the emotion between the author and the text. Equally important to notice that the changes occur in file 3 whereas soul’s trend goes up and sad’s trend goes down. This means that the speaker’s soul is under high stress which later decreases in the last stanza. As a result, I examined a final trend to see the correlation between “sad,” “song,” and “soul.”  </p>

<iframe style='width: 40%; height: 350px' src='//voyant-tools.org/?query=soul*&query=sad%20&query=song%20&query=soul%20&bins=5&corpus=305ddd6e69bfce57c7e4f0035036c21d&view=Trends'></iframe>

<p>Here, the finding shows great harmony in the uses of these three words and establishes that the emotion here is really negative (sadness). Additionally, to some extent, I can confirm that files 2 and 4, which consist of stanzas 1 and 3, underscore much the same sadness. 
All in all, this was an attempt to examine the significance of the most frequently used words in the poem by using a wonderful tool. Despite that fact that it was a trail, but I have to admit that it was a beneficial experience where I can trace the frequent words and analyze the findings through the useful tools that Voyant provides to its scholar users. It makes it easy to get the major theme of the literary works and practice theory approach on the content.
